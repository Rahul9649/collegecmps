process for students participating in the Governmentâ€™s KEAM (Kerala Engineering, Architecture,
and Medical) allotment. The website provides a user-friendly platform where students can input
their preferences, such as location, placements, and desired courses. Based on these preferences,
the website generates a curated list of colleges in the correct order for the student to apply on the
official KEAM allotment page. The website also offers user account creation, allowing students to
receive notifications regarding their allotment status. By leveraging this online platform, students
can save time and effort in searching for suitable colleges, ensuring they make informed decisions
